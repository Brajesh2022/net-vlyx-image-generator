# Multi-Season Selection and Filtering Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of multi-season selection and filtering functionality for TV series in the `/v` pages. The feature ensures that users can select a specific season before downloading or watching, and only see links relevant to their selected season.

## Problem Statement

For multi-season TV series (e.g., titles containing "Season 1-3" or "Season 2-4"):
- Users previously saw all seasons' download links mixed together
- There was no way to filter links by specific season
- This led to confusion about which links belonged to which season

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Season Range Detection

Added a new function `detectSeasonRange()` that detects multi-season ranges from titles:

**Supported Patterns:**
- `Season 1-3` or `Season 1–3` (with en-dash or em-dash)
- `S1-3` or `S2-4`
- `(Season 1–5)` (from titles like "Breaking Bad (Season 1–5)")

**Function:** `detectSeasonRange(title: string)`
- Returns: `{ hasRange: boolean, seasons: number[] }`
- Example: "Breaking Bad (Season 1-3)" → `{ hasRange: true, seasons: [1, 2, 3] }`

### 2. State Management

Added a new state variable:
```typescript
const [selectedSeason, setSelectedSeason] = useState<number | null>(null)
```

This tracks which season the user has selected from the multi-season options.

### 3. User Flow Enhancement

#### New Step 0: Season Selection (for multi-season series only)

**When:** Title contains a season range (e.g., "Season 1-3")
**Display:** Grid of season buttons showing each available season
**Action:** User selects their desired season
**UI:** 
- Responsive grid layout (2 columns on mobile, 3-4 on desktop)
- Gradient background with hover effects
- Clear season numbers and labels

#### Updated Step 1: Mode Selection (Download or Watch)

**When:** After season is selected (or if no multi-season range detected)
**Display:** "Download" or "Watch Online" options
**Addition:** Back button to return to season selection (if multi-season)

#### Steps 2, 2.5, and 3: Conditional Display

All subsequent steps now check:
1. If a season range exists, only proceed if a season is selected
2. If no season range exists, proceed normally

### 4. Download Filtering

Updated `separateDownloads()` function to filter by selected season:

**Logic:**
```typescript
// If a season is selected, filter by that season
const itemSeason = section.season || link.season
if (selectedSeason !== null && itemSeason) {
  const seasonNum = parseInt(itemSeason)
  if (seasonNum !== selectedSeason) {
    return // Skip items that don't match the selected season
  }
}
```

**Impact:**
- Only downloads matching the selected season are shown
- Both episode-wise and bulk downloads are filtered
- Applies to all quality options

### 5. Quality Selection and Modal Display

**Automatic Filtering:**
- The quality selection screen only shows qualities available for the selected season
- The download modal only displays links for the selected season
- If a specific host (like N-Cloud) doesn't have links for the selected season, it won't be shown

**Example:**
- User selects Season 1
- System has N-Cloud links for Season 2, G-Direct for Season 1
- User sees only G-Direct option (Season 1 links)
- N-Cloud option is hidden (no Season 1 links)

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario: Multi-Season TV Series

1. **User visits page** for "Breaking Bad (Season 1-3)"
2. **Season Selection appears** showing buttons for Season 1, Season 2, and Season 3
3. **User selects Season 2**
4. **Mode Selection appears** with "Download" or "Watch Online" options (+ back button)
5. **User selects "Download"**
6. **Download Type Selection** appears (Episode-wise or Bulk)
7. **User selects quality** from available options for Season 2 only
8. **Download modal shows** only Season 2 links for the selected quality
9. **User sees only relevant hosts** that have Season 2 content

### Scenario: Single Season or Movie

1. **User visits page** (no multi-season range in title)
2. **Mode Selection appears immediately** (no season selection step)
3. **Normal flow continues** as before

## Technical Implementation Details

### Modified Files

- `app/v/[...slug]/page.tsx`

### Key Functions Added/Modified

1. **detectSeasonRange(title: string)**
   - Detects multi-season ranges from titles
   - Returns season list and hasRange flag

2. **separateDownloads()**
   - Now filters by selectedSeason
   - Checks section.season and link.season
   - Only includes items matching selected season

3. **UI Components**
   - Added Season Selection UI (Step 0)
   - Updated all step conditionals to check for season selection
   - Added back navigation to season selection

### State Flow

```
Multi-Season Detected → Season Selection → Mode Selection → ... → Quality Selection → Filtered Links
No Multi-Season → Mode Selection → ... → Quality Selection → All Links
```

## Benefits

### For Users

3. **Better Organization**: Structured flow through season → mode → type → quality
4. **Accurate Results**: No mixing of different seasons' links
5. **Host Availability**: Only see hosts that have the selected season

### For System

1. **Proper Filtering**: Accurate season-based link filtering
2. **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing single-season content
3. **Scalable**: Supports any number of seasons in a range
4. **Clean Code**: Well-structured conditional rendering
5. **No Breaking Changes**: Existing non-multi-season content works as before

## Testing

### Build Status
✅ Successfully compiled with no errors
✅ All routes generated successfully
✅ No TypeScript errors

## Conclusion

The multi-season selection and filtering feature provides a much-improved user experience for TV series with multiple seasons. Users now have a clear, structured flow to select their desired season and see only relevant download options. The implementation is backward compatible, scalable, and has been successfully tested with no build errors.
