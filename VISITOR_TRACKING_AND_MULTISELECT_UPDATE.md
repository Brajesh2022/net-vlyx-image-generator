# Visitor Tracking & Multi-Select Delete Features

## Features Implemented

### 1. Domain-Restricted Visitor Tracking ✅

**Location:** `/hooks/useVisitorTracking.ts`

**Change:** Only track visitors from the official domain (netvlyx.vercel.app)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Check current domain before tracking
const currentDomain = typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.location.hostname : ''
const isOfficialDomain = currentDomain === 'netvlyx.vercel.app' || currentDomain === 'localhost'

if (!isOfficialDomain) {
  console.log('Visitor tracking skipped: not from official domain')
  return
}
```

**Behavior:**
- ✅ Tracks visits from `netvlyx.vercel.app`
- ✅ Tracks visits from `localhost` (for development)
- ❌ Does NOT track visits from other domains (proxies, mirrors, alternate domains)
- ❌ Does NOT track if site is accessed via direct IP or other domains

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents duplicate tracking from mirror sites
- Ensures analytics only reflect actual official domain usage
- Reduces Firebase storage costs by filtering out unwanted traffic
- Protects privacy for users accessing from unofficial domains

### 2. Long-Press Multi-Select Delete ✅

**Location:** `/components/visitor-analytics-enhanced.tsx`

**Feature:** Long-press on history cards to enter selection mode and delete multiple records

**How It Works:**

#### Long-Press Detection (500ms)
```typescript
const handleLongPressStart = (itemId: string) => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setSelectionMode(true)
    setSelectedItems(new Set([itemId]))
  }, 500) // 500ms long press
  setLongPressTimer(timer)
}
```

#### Touch & Mouse Support
- **Mobile:** `onTouchStart` / `onTouchEnd`
- **Desktop:** `onMouseDown` / `onMouseUp` / `onMouseLeave`

#### Selection Mode Features:
1. **Enter Selection Mode:**
   - Long-press any history card (500ms)
   - Card automatically gets selected
   - Checkboxes appear on all cards
   - Selection toolbar appears at top

2. **Select Multiple:**
   - Tap/click any card to toggle selection
   - Use "Select All" checkbox in table header (desktop)
   - Selected cards show purple highlight and ring

3. **Delete Selected:**
   - Click "Delete Selected" button in toolbar
   - Shows count of selected items
   - Confirmation dialog requires typing "clear"
   - Deletes all selected records at once

4. **Exit Selection Mode:**
   - Click "Cancel" button
   - Auto-exits when all items deselected

#### UI Indicators:

**Desktop Table View:**

## Technical Details

### State Management:
```typescript
const [selectionMode, setSelectionMode] = useState(false)
const [selectedItems, setSelectedItems] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set())
const [longPressTimer, setLongPressTimer] = useState<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null)
```

### Long-Press Timer:
- **Duration:** 500ms
- **Event Handlers:** Touch and Mouse events
- **Auto-cleanup:** Clears timer on release

### Delete Operation:
```typescript
for (const item of itemsToDelete) {
  const collectionName = item.type === 'unique' ? 'visitor-tracking' : 'visitor-impressions'
  await deleteDoc(doc(db, collectionName, item.id))
}
```

### Firestore Collections:
- `visitor-tracking` - Unique visitors
- `visitor-impressions` - Return visits
