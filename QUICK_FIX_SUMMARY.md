# Quick Fix Summary - Android Intents

## Problem
❌ External players (VLC, MX Player) were not opening on Android
❌ Users redirected to Play Store even with apps installed
❌ Watch buttons not working properly

## Solution
✅ Fixed Android intent URIs with proper format
✅ Added fallback URLs for missing apps
✅ Works across all platforms (Android, iOS, Desktop)

## What Was Changed

### 2 Files Fixed:
1. `app/ncloud/page.tsx` - Streaming popup intents
2. `app/play/[...id]/page.tsx` - Player launch functions

### 7 Intents Fixed:
- VLC Player (ncloud)
- MX Player (ncloud)
- Generic Player (ncloud)
- VLC Player (play)
- MX Player Free (play)
- MX Player Pro (play)
- handleWatchOnline function (ncloud)

## The Fix

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
intent:${videoUrl}#Intent;package=org.videolan.vlc;scheme=https;end
```

### After (Working):
```javascript
intent://${videoUrl.replace(/^https?:\/\//i, '')}#Intent;scheme=https;action=android.intent.action.VIEW;package=org.videolan.vlc;S.browser_fallback_url=${encodeURIComponent(videoUrl)};end
```

## Key Changes:
1. ✅ Added `intent://` prefix
2. ✅ Stripped http(s):// from URL
3. ✅ Added `action=android.intent.action.VIEW`
4. ✅ Added `S.browser_fallback_url` for when app is missing
