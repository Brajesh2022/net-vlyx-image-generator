## 🚀 How It Works

### Example Flow: Searching "Panchayat"

**1. User searches:**
```
Home → Search "Panchayat" → API: /api/movies4u-search?s=panchayat
```

**2. Results from movies4u.contact:**
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "Panchayat (2025) Season 4...",
      "image": "https://movies4u.contact/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/...",
      "link": "https://movies4u.contact/panchayat-2025-season-4...",
      "category": "Web Series"
    }
  ]
}
```

**3. User clicks → Movie page:**
```
/v/{encoded_url}
```

**4. API fetches movie details:**
```
API: /api/movies4u-movie?url=https://movies4u.contact/panchayat-2025-season-4...

Returns:
- watchOnlineUrl: "https://m4uplay.com/file/ewui5ajm0ynh"
- screenshots: ["https://i.ibb.co/...", "https://i.ibb.co/..."]
- downloadSections: [
    {
      title: "Season 4 Single Episodes 480p [120MB/E]",
      downloads: [{
        quality: "480p",
        size: "120MB/E",
        links: [
          { label: "Download Links", url: "https://m4ulinks.com/number/39719" },
          { label: "BATCH/ZIP", url: "https://m4ulinks.com/number/39721" }
        ]
      }]
    }
  ]
```

**5. User clicks "Play Here":**
```
/play-here?id=tt12004706&extra=https://m4uplay.com/file/ewui5ajm0ynh

Shows:
- Primary video player
- Alternative button → opens watch URL
```

**6. User selects 480p download:**
```
/vlyxdrive?key={encoded}&quality=480p
```

**7. VlyxDrive detects m4ulinks:**
```
API: /api/m4ulinks-scraper?url=https://m4ulinks.com/number/39719

Returns:
{
  "linkData": [
    { "episodeNumber": 1, "links": [...] },
    { "episodeNumber": 2, "links": [...] },
    ...
  ],
  "type": "episode",
  "totalEpisodes": 8
}
```

**8. TMDB episode data fetched:**
```
API: /api/tmdb-episodes?id=12004706&season=4

Matches episodes by number
Shows: Episode 1: "Gram Panchayat Rules"
```

**9. User clicks Episode 1:**
```
Modal shows:
- ⚡ Hub-Cloud [DD] (Preferred)
- 🚀 GDFlix
- [Show 2 More Options]
```

**10. User clicks Hub-Cloud:**
```
/ncloud?key={encoded}&action=download

Uses URL: https://hubcloud.fit/video/dxdkbhtxko5hegn ✅ (CORRECT!)
Fetches successfully
Shows download links
```

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical Fix: HubCloud URL Paths
**Problem:** URLs like `https://hubcloud.fit/video/{id}` were being reconstructed as `/drive/{id}`

**Solution:** 
- Pass full URL in encoded params
- Use URL directly without reconstruction
- Support any path (`/video/`, `/drive/`, `/file/`)

### Other Fixes:
- Type compatibility between APIs
- Parameter validation (id OR url)
- Graceful fallbacks
- Debug logging
