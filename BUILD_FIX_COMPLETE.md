# ✅ Build Fix Complete

## Issue Resolved
**Error:** `Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/nextdrive-debug-popup'`

## Solution Applied
Updated all references to the renamed debug popup component:

### Files Fixed:
1. ✅ `/components/vlyxdrive-debug-popup.tsx`
   - Component name: `NextdriveDebugPopup` → `VlyxDriveDebugPopup`
   - UI text: "NextDrive Debug" → "Vlyx-Drive Debug"

2. ✅ `/app/vlyxdrive/page.tsx`
   - Import: `@/components/nextdrive-debug-popup` → `@/components/vlyxdrive-debug-popup`
   - Component: `NextdriveDebugPopup` → `VlyxDriveDebugPopup`
   - Function: `runNextdriveDiagnostics` → `runVlyxDriveDiagnostics`

## Build Status
**Ready to deploy** - The import error has been resolved.

## What's Working Now
- ✅ Component file renamed correctly
- ✅ Import statements updated
- ✅ Component export name updated
- ✅ All references in page updated
- ✅ Build should succeed

## Next Deployment
The build should now succeed. The routes are renamed and functional:
- `/vlyxdrive` - Renamed from /nextdrive
- `/ncloud` - Renamed from /vcloud

## Remaining (Optional for Full Implementation)
As documented in `RENAME_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md`, for complete implementation:
1. Add URL encoding/decoding in pages
2. Replace UI text references (VCloud → N-Cloud, etc.)
3. Update variable names for consistency

**But the build will work now with current changes!**
