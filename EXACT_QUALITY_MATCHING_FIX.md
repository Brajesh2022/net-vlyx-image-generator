# Exact Quality Matching Fix

## Problem

**User specified:** `quality=720p`  
**Available:** `720p [1.5GB]` and `720p HEVC [1.2GB]`  
**System selected:** `720p HEVC` ❌ WRONG!

**Why:** Fuzzy matching was too loose - it allowed partial matches in both directions:
```typescript
// OLD LOGIC (WRONG)
if (normalizedItem.includes(normalizedTarget) || 
    normalizedTarget.includes(normalizedItem)) {
  return true
}

// When target = "720p" and item = "720p HEVC":
"720phevc".includes("720p") = true ❌
// Incorrectly matches!
```

---

## Solution

**Changed to EXACT matching only:**

```typescript
// NEW LOGIC (CORRECT)
const matchesQuality = (itemQuality: string, targetQuality: string): boolean => {
  if (!targetQuality || !itemQuality) return false
  
  const normalize = (q: string) => q.toLowerCase().replace(/[\s\-_]/g, '')
  const normalizedItem = normalize(itemQuality)
  const normalizedTarget = normalize(targetQuality)
  
  // ✅ EXACT match only
  return normalizedItem === normalizedTarget
}
```

## What Normalizations Are Supported

The `normalize()` function removes spaces, dashes, underscores, and makes lowercase:

### ✅ **Will Match (Same Quality)**

| User Input | Available Quality | Match? | Reason |
|-----------|------------------|--------|--------|
| `720p` | `720P` | ✅ Yes | Case insensitive |
| `720p` | `720 p` | ✅ Yes | Spaces removed |
| `720p` | `720-p` | ✅ Yes | Dashes removed |
| `720p HEVC` | `720pHEVC` | ✅ Yes | Spaces removed |
| `720p HEVC` | `720P-HEVC` | ✅ Yes | Case + dashes |
| `1080p` | `1080P` | ✅ Yes | Case insensitive |

### ❌ **Will NOT Match (Different Quality)**

| User Input | Available Quality | Match? | Reason |
|-----------|------------------|--------|--------|
| `720p` | `720p HEVC` | ❌ No | Different formats |
| `1080p` | `1080p HEVC` | ❌ No | Different formats |
| `720p` | `720p [1.5GB]` | ❌ No | Size info included |
| `480p` | `720p` | ❌ No | Different resolutions |

## Examples

### **Example 1: Exact Match**
```
User selected: quality=720p
Available: 480p, 720p, 720p HEVC, 1080p

Result: ✅ Matches "720p"
Display: Only 720p [1.5GB] section shown
```

### **Example 2: No Exact Match**
```
User selected: quality=720p
Available: 480p, 720p HEVC, 1080p (NO plain 720p)

Result: ❌ No match
Display: Warning + all qualities shown expanded
```

### **Example 3: Case/Space Variations**
```
User selected: quality=720p%20HEVC
Available: 480p, 720p, 720P-HEVC, 1080p

Normalized target: "720phevc"
Normalized item: "720phevc"
Result: ✅ Matches "720P-HEVC"
```

---

## Impact on User Experience

### **Before (WRONG):**
```
User selects: 720p
System shows: 720p HEVC [1.2GB] ❌
User confused: "I wanted 720p, not HEVC!"
```

### **After (CORRECT):**
```
User selects: 720p
Available: 720p [1.5GB] and 720p HEVC [1.2GB]
System shows: Only 720p [1.5GB] ✅
User happy: Got exactly what they wanted!
```

### **If Exact Match Not Found:**
```
User selects: 720p
Available: Only 720p HEVC [1.2GB] (no plain 720p)

System shows:
⚠️ 720p quality not found
▲ All qualities expanded
  ├─ 480p [750MB] ▼
  ├─ 720p HEVC [1.2GB] ▼
  └─ 1080p [3.3GB] ▼

User can: Choose 720p HEVC or any other quality
```

## Files Modified

**File:** `/workspace/app/vlyxdrive/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. Line 180-197: Removed partial matching logic in data fetching
2. Line 961-969: Removed partial matching logic in UI rendering
3. Both now use exact matching only

---

## Benefits

✅ **Precise:** User gets exactly what they requested  
✅ **Predictable:** 720p always means 720p, not 720p HEVC  
✅ **Clear:** If exact match not found, show all options  
✅ **No Confusion:** HEVC and non-HEVC are treated as separate qualities
