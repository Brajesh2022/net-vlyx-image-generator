## New Architecture Flow

### Search Flow (movies4u)
1. User searches on home page
2. Home page calls `/api/movies4u-search?s={query}`
3. API scrapes movies4u.contact search results
4. Returns array of results with title, image, link

### Movie Details Flow (movies4u)
1. User clicks movie from search/home
2. Navigate to `/v` page with encoded movies4u URL
3. `/v` page calls `/api/movies4u-movie?url={movie_url}`
4. API returns:
   - Movie details (title, poster, IMDb, plot)
   - Screenshots array (for gallery)
   - Watch Online URL (optional)
   - Download sections with quality

### Watch Online Flow
1. If movie has "Watch Online" URL
2. Generate Play Here link: `/play-here?id={imdb_id}&extra={watch_url}`
3. Play Here page shows:
   - Primary video player (existing)
   - Alternative button linking to watch URL (NEW)

### Download Flow (movies4u)
1. User selects quality on /v page
2. Navigate to `/vlyxdrive?url={m4ulinks_url}&quality={quality}`
3. `/vlyxdrive` page calls `/api/m4ulinks-scraper?url={url}`
4. API returns links grouped by quality
5. Page filters to show only matching quality
6. Prioritizes vcloud/hubcloud links
7. "Show More" button reveals other options

### Download Link Processing
1. vcloud.zip links â†’ send to `/ncloud` (treated as ncloud)
2. hubcloud.* links â†’ send to `/ncloud` (treated as ncloud)
3. Other links â†’ open in new tab

## Key Differences: Vegamovies vs Movies4U

### Search Results
- **Vegamovies:** `article.entry-card` or `article.post-item`
- **Movies4U:** `<article>` with `h3.entry-title a`

### Movie Page Structure
- **Vegamovies:** Uses `.single-service-content`, `.entry-inner`
- **Movies4U:** Uses similar structure but with different class names
  - Watch Online: `div.watch-links-div`
  - Screenshots: `div.container.ss-img`
  - Downloads: `div.download-links-div`

### Download Links
- **Vegamovies:** Links to nexdrive.pro/biz/ink
- **Movies4U:** Links to m4ulinks.com (which then shows vcloud/hubcloud/gdrive)

### Link Providers
- **Vegamovies:** NextDrive, V-Cloud, GDirect, GDToT
- **Movies4U:** vcloud.zip, hubcloud.fit, G-Drive, others

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Search functionality works with movies4u
- [ ] Movie details page displays correctly
- [ ] Screenshots gallery displays properly
- [ ] Watch Online integration works
- [ ] Download links are properly filtered by quality
- [ ] vcloud links work via /ncloud
- [ ] hubcloud links work via /ncloud
- [ ] "Show More Quality Options" button works
- [ ] Multi-season series handled correctly
- [ ] Episode-wise downloads work

## Notes
- Keep TMDB integration unchanged (trending, popular, etc.)
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- The fundamental flow (Search â†’ Movie Page â†’ Download) remains the same
- The domain movies4u.contact may change; structure should remain adaptable
