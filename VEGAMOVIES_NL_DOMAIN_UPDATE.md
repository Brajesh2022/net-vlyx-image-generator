# VegaMovies-NL Domain Update - Fixed Image Loading Issue

## Issue
The home page was not able to load images properly. Images were appearing as base64 encoded strings instead of actual image URLs. This was because vegamovies-nl changed their domain from `vegamovies-nl.run` to `vegamovies-nl.autos`.

## Root Cause
1. **Domain Change**: VegaMovies-NL changed their domain from `.run` to `.autos`
2. **Scraper Using Old Domain**: Our scrapers were still pointing to the old domain, causing image fetching to fail
3. **Base64 Encoding**: The SecureImage component was encoding image URLs using base64 for security (this is CORRECT behavior), but the underlying issue was the wrong domain

## Solution
Updated all references from `vegamovies-nl.run` to `vegamovies-nl.autos` across the codebase:

### Files Updated:
1. ✅ `/app/api/scrape/route.ts` - Base URL and all category URLs
2. ✅ `/app/api/category/latest/route.ts` - Base URL
3. ✅ `/app/api/category/[category]/route.ts` - All category URLs
4. ✅ `/app/api/scrape-vega/route.ts` - luxLike source URL
5. ✅ `/app/page.tsx` - Default fallback source URL
6. ✅ `/app/view-all/page.tsx` - Default source URL
7. ✅ `/app/vega-nl/[...slug]/page.tsx` - Default source URL
8. ✅ `/app/category/page.tsx` - Default source URL
9. ✅ `/components/category-row.tsx` - Default source URL

## HTML Structure Compatibility
The scrapers already support the new HTML structure from vegamovies-nl.autos:

```html
<!-- NEW DESIGN (2025) - Already Supported -->
<article class="post-item">
  <div class="blog-pic">
    <div class="blog-pic-wrap">
      <a href="..." class="blog-img">
        <img class="blog-picture ul-normal-classic" 
             src="https://www.vegamovies-nl.autos/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mirage-165x248.jpg"
             alt="Mirage"/>
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3 class="entry-title post-title">
    <a href="...">Mirage (2025) Dual Audio...</a>
  </h3>
</article>
```

Our parser supports both:
- `article.entry-card` (newer design)
- `article.post-item` (current design as shown in your HTML)

And extracts images using:
- `img.blog-picture` (as shown in your HTML)
- `img.wp-post-image` (alternative)
- `a.ct-media-container img` (newer alternative)

## About Base64 Encoding
**IMPORTANT**: The base64 encoding you saw in browser inspector is NOT a bug - it's a security feature!

### Why We Use Base64 Encoding:
1. **Security**: We encode image URLs to prevent direct hotlinking and protect the source
2. **Privacy**: Users' browsing of specific movies is not exposed in image URLs
3. **Proxy Protection**: Our image proxy uses encrypted tokens to validate requests

### How It Works:
```
Original URL: https://www.vegamovies-nl.autos/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mirage-165x248.jpg
         ↓
Encoded:  /api/img/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmVnYW1vdmllcy1ubC5hdXRvcy93cC1jb250ZW50L3VwbG9hZHMvMjAyNS8xMC9NaXJhZ2UtMTY1eDI0OC5qcGc?t=token
         ↓
Image Proxy fetches and serves the actual image
```

This is the CORRECT behavior and should NOT be changed!

## Result
✅ Home page images should now load correctly
✅ Search functionality continues to work (it was already correct)
✅ All category pages updated
✅ Image encoding/proxy system preserved (as requested - NO changes to encoding)

## Testing
After deployment, verify:
1. Home page loads images correctly
2. Category pages (Bollywood, South Movies, etc.) load images
3. Search results show images
4. All images load through the secure proxy system

## Notes
- The scraping API (`vlyx-scrapping.vercel.app`) remains unchanged
- Image proxy security features remain intact
- No changes were made to image encoding (as per your request)
- Only the source domain was updated to match vegamovies-nl's new domain
