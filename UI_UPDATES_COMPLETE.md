## 🎯 Technical Implementation

### State Management Updates

```typescript
// Added new states for advanced clearing
const [clearMode, setClearMode] = useState<'time' | 'count'>('time')
const [clearTimeRange, setClearTimeRange] = useState('30min')
const [customMinutes, setCustomMinutes] = useState('')
const [clearCount, setClearCount] = useState('')
const [showDeleteConfirm, setShowDeleteConfirm] = useState<string | null>(null)
const [deleteConfirmText, setDeleteConfirmText] = useState('')
```

### Clear Data Logic

```typescript
const handleClearData = async () => {
  // Validate confirmation text
  if (clearConfirmText.toLowerCase() !== 'clear') return

  // Calculate items to delete based on mode
  if (clearMode === 'time') {
    // Time-based deletion with preset or custom minutes
    const thresholdTime = Date.now() - (minutes * 60 * 1000)
    itemsToDelete = allItems.filter(item => item.timestamp >= thresholdTime)
  } else {
    // Count-based deletion (most recent N items)
    itemsToDelete = allItems
      .sort((a, b) => b.timestamp - a.timestamp)
      .slice(0, count)
  }

  // Delete from Firestore
  for (const item of itemsToDelete) {
    const collection = item.type === 'unique' 
      ? 'visitor-tracking' 
      : 'visitor-impressions'
    await deleteDoc(doc(db, collection, item.id))
  }
}
```

### Delete Single Item Logic

```typescript
const handleDeleteSingleItem = async (itemId: string, itemType: 'unique' | 'impression') => {
  if (deleteConfirmText.toLowerCase() !== 'clear') return

  const collection = itemType === 'unique' 
    ? 'visitor-tracking' 
    : 'visitor-impressions'
  await deleteDoc(doc(db, collection, itemId))
  
  fetchAnalytics() // Refresh data
}
```
